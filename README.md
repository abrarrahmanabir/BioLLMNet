## BioLLMNet: Enhancing RNA-Interaction Prediction with a Specialized Cross-LLM Transformation Network

**BioLLMNet** is a unified, sequence-only deep learning framework for predicting RNA interactions across multiple modalities: RNA–protein, RNA–small molecule, and RNA–RNA. It leverages pretrained biological language models to extract contextualized embeddings and employs a novel **learnable gating mechanism** to dynamically fuse multimodal information.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abrarrahmanabir/DeepRNA-Twist.git](https://github.com/abrarrahmanabir/BioLLMNet.git
   cd BioLLMNet

### Usage
This repository includes three Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a specific interaction type:
- `rna_protein.ipynb`: RNA–Protein interaction prediction
- `rna_molecule.ipynb`: RNA–Small Molecule interaction prediction
- `rna_rna.ipynb`: RNA–RNA interaction prediction

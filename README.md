## BioLLMNet: Enhancing RNA-Interaction Prediction with a Specialized Cross-LLM Transformation Network

**BioLLMNet** is a unified, sequence-only deep learning framework for predicting RNA interactions across multiple modalities: RNA–protein, RNA–small molecule, and RNA–RNA. It leverages pretrained biological language models to extract contextualized embeddings and employs a novel **learnable gating mechanism** to dynamically fuse multimodal information.
